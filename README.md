## Why?

There are several date formatting libraries out there. It all started with [Moment](https://momentjs.com), while nowadays smaller alternatives such as [date-fns](https://date-fns.org), [DayJS](https://day.js.org) and [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) among others are raising in popularity.<br>
While [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) already comes in a really small format, it was still way to big for my most common use case: Format a date with a given pattern.<br>
So I created this tiny library as an attempt to solve this specific problem with as little bytes as possible.

## How it works

I was using [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) previously and really liked it. So I had the idea to use that under the hood while providing a nice API that accepts a pattern in a widely used format.<br>
The nice thing about [Intl.DateTimeFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) is that it has built-in i18n support.

## Browser Support

It works in all modern browsers.<br>

> However, if you need to support IE11, pick one of the libraries mentioned above!

## Installation

```sh
yarn add small-date
```

## Usage

The libraries exports a single function that accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type      | Description                                               |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date      | `Date`    | The date that is formatted                                |
| Pattern  | `string`   | The pattern in which the date should be formatted         |
| Config   | `Object`   | A config option that accepts a `locale` and a `timeZone`  |

```javascript
import { format } from 'small-date'

// Wednesday 03 March 2021, 11:45 am
format(new Date(), 'DDD dd MMMM yyyy, hh:mm a')

// Mittwoch 03 März 2021, 11:45
format(new Date(), 'DDD dd MMMM yyyy, HH:mm', {
  locale: 'de-DE',
})
```

### Escaping Text

Sometimes we want to add arbitary text into our pattern. The problem is: Words break if they include tokens. Therefore, it is safest to escape all words with `"` quotes.

```javascript
import { format } from 'small-date'

// Today is Wednesday the 03. of March
format(new Date(), '"Today is" DDD "the" dd. "of" MMMM')
```

### TimeZone

We can pass a `timeZone` to the configuration to get the locale date at this particular zone.

```javascript
import { format } from 'small-date'

// Wednesday 03 March 2021, 09:45 pm
format(new Date(), 'DDD dd MMMM yyyy, hh:mm a', {
  timeZone: 'Australia/Sydney',
})
```

## Pattern Tokens

> All examples below use the following date: `new Date(2021, 2, 3, 18, 7, 8, 9)` and the `en-US` locale.

| Token |  Description                    | Example                          |
